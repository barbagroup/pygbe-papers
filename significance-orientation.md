* initial reports of highly significant research of broad interest to the chemical physics community through rapid Communications.

Authors are asked to provide a brief explanation below indicating how their manuscripts fulfills one or more of the above criteria for acceptance. 

**Statement of manuscript significance**

This paper's application of technological relevance is in the field of biosensors, 
and the results are instrumental for simulation-assisted biosensor design. 
Favorable orientation of ligand molecules on bioactive surfaces is critical 
in biosensor sensitivity and performance. But studies so far have not resolved 
the question of how orientation can be influenced by surface preparation. 
This work considers the effect of electrostatic adsorption, increasing understanding 
of how nanosurface properties (charge) and preparation conditions (salt levels) 
affect protein orientation. Our results find  conditions for high-probability 
favorable orientation for the antibody immunoglobulin G iso-type IgG2a, which 
was not found to have a preferred orientation in previous studies. The results 
also show that local interactions dominate over dipole moment for this protein. 
Improving immunoassay sensitivity may thus be assisted by numerical studies using 
our method, guiding changes to fabrication protocols or protein engineering of 
ligand molecules to obtain more favorable orientations.
