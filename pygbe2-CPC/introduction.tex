Interactions between proteins and solid surfaces are ubiquitous in many biological processes. Adsorption plays a role in natural activity, like blood coagulation, and is also a key mechanism in biotechnologies like tissue engineering, biomedical implants and biosensors.
A full understanding of protein-surface interactions has remained elusive \cite{Gray2004,RabeVerdesSeegel2011}, but adsorption mechanisms are governed by surface energy and often the dominant effect is electrostatics.

Protein electrostatics can be studied via modeling approaches using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and implicit-solvent representations. These models  are popular for computing solvation energies in protein systems \cite{RouxSimonson1999,Bardhan2012}, but few studies have included the effect of surfaces. Lenhoff and co-workers studied surface-protein interactions using continuum models discretized with boundary-element \cite{YoonLenhoff1992,RothLenhoff1993,AsthagiriLenhoff1997} and finite-difference methods \cite{YaoLenhoff2004,YaoLenhoff2005}, in the context of ion-exchange chromatography. They realized that van der Waals effects can be neglected for realistic molecular geometries \cite{RothNealLenhoff1996} and that the model is adequate as long as conformational changes in the protein are slight \cite{YaoLenhoff2004,YaoLenhoff2005}. 

The aim of this work is to develop and assess a computational model to simulate proteins near engineered surfaces of fixed charge, using implicit-solvent electrostatics.
We have added the capability of modeling a protein near a charged surface to our code \pygbe, an open-source code\footnote{\url{https://github.com/barbagroup/pygbe}}  that solves the Poisson-Boltzmann equations via an integral formulation, using a fast multipole algorithm and \gpu\ hardware acceleration.  Previously, we verified and validated \pygbe in its use to obtain solvation and binding energies, by comparing with analytical solutions of the equations and with results obtained using the well-known \apbs software \cite{CooperBarba-share154331,CooperBardhanBarba2013}. 
In the present work, we derived an analytical solution for a spherical molecule interacting with a spherical surface of prescribed charge, and used it to verify the code in its new application and study numerical convergence.
Using the newly extended code, we also studied the interaction between protein GB1 D4' and a solid surface of imposed charge, with the goal of comparing our results with published studies using both experimental methods\cite{BaioWeidnerBaughGambleStaytonCastner2012} and molecular simulations.\cite{LiuLiaoZhou2013}

We anticipate our new modeling tool to be useful for studying the behavior of proteins as they adsorb on surfaces that have been functionalized with  self-assembled monolayers (\sam), for example, which are modeled as a surface with prescribed charge within an implicit-solvent framework. 
One application is biosensing, where the target molecule is attached to the sensor through a ligand molecule (in many cases an antibody). The performance of the biosensor is then crucially affected by the orientation of the ligand molecule \cite{TajimaTakaiIshihara2011,TrillingBeekwilderZuilhof2013}, whose binding sites must be physically accessible to the target molecule. Studies of protein orientation near charged surfaces using this model could thus aid the design of better biosensors. We explore this application in a companion publication that studies orientation of an antibody near a surface and the effect of changing the conditions of surface preparation (charge and ionic strength).\cite{CooperBarba2015b}. Here, we present the details of the new analytical solution for charged surface and molecule of spherical geometry, grid-convergence studies for the interaction free energy in this case, and grid-convergence studies for protein GB1 alone and interacting with a charged surface. The detailed analysis of the model is complemented with a diligent effort for reproducibility and we deposit both input and results data in accessible and permanent archival storage.
