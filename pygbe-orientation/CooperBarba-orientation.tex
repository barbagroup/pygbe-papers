\begin{abstract}

Protein-surface interactions are ubiquitous in biological processes and bioengineering, yet are not fully understood. 
In the field of biosensors, a key factor in biosensor performance is the orientation of the ligand molecule, that attaches the target molecule to the sensor.
The aim of this work is to study proteins interacting with a \sam-coated sensor (represented as a charged surface) and obtain orientation data, with an implicit-solvent model. 
We studied the preferred orientation of protein GB1 D4$^\prime$ and immunoglobulin G near a charged surface using an extension of the implicit-solvent model in the code \pygbe, that includes the effect of charged surfaces.
Sampling the free energy for protein GB1 at a range of tilt and rotation angles with respect to the charged surface, we calculated the probability of the protein orientation and observed a dipolar behavior. 
This result is consistent with published molecular-dynamics simulations and experimental studies using this protein. 
The case of immunoglobulin G is more challenging due to the large size of the molecule, but it is also more relevant to biosensor technology. 
The probability distribution of orientations for this protein at varying surface charge and salt concentration suggests that it is easier to control the antibody orientation with low salt concentration and high surface charge. The results also show that local interactions dominate over dipole moment for this protein. In view of its capacity to deal with much larger biomolecules than direct simulation, this implicit-solvent model can offer a valuable approach in biosensor studies.

\subsection{Reproducibility and data management}
We have a consistent reproducibility practice that includes releasing code and data associated with a publication. The \pygbe code was released at the time of submitting our previous publication,\cite{CooperBardhanBarba2013} under an MIT open-source license, and we maintain a version-control repository. As with our previous paper, we also release with this work all of the data needed to run the numerical experiments reported here, including running scripts and post-processing code in Python for producing the figures. To support our open-science goals, we prepared such a \emph{``reproducibility package''} for each of the results presented in Figures \ref{fig:1PGB_probability}, \ref{fig:1IGT_convergence}, and the probability plots in Figures \ref{fig:1IGT_negcharge} and \ref{fig:1IGT_poscharge}. The included running scripts invoke the \pygbe code with the correct input data and meshes (also included), and post-process the results to give the final figure, all with just one command. Please see the respective captions for a reference to the reproducibility packages, hosted on the \textbf{figshare} repository.
