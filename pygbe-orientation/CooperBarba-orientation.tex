\begin{abstract}

Protein-surface interactions are ubiquitous in biological processes and bioengineering, yet are not fully understood. 
In biosensors, a key factor determining the sensitivity and thus the performance of the device is the orientation of the ligand molecules on the bioactive device surface. Adsorption studies thus seek to determine how orientation can be influenced by surface preparation, varying surface charge and ambient salt concentration.
In this work, protein orientation near charged nanosurfaces is obtained under electrostatic effects using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in an implicit-solvent model.
Sampling the free energy for protein \gb at a range of tilt and rotation angles with respect to the charged surface, we calculated the probability of the protein orientations and observed a dipolar behavior. This result is consistent with published experimental studies and combined Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations using this small protein, validating our method. 
More relevant to biosensor technology, antibodies such as immunoglobulin G are still a formidable challenge to molecular simulation, due to their large size. 
With the Poisson-Boltzmann model, we obtained the probability distribution of orientations for the iso-type {\small IgG2a} at varying surface charge and salt concentration.
This iso-type was not found to have a preferred orientation in previous studies, unlike the iso-type {\small IgG1} whose larger dipole moment was assumed to make it easier to control.  
Our results show that the preferred orientation of {\small IgG2a} can be favorable for biosensing with positive charge on the surface of 0.05C/m$^{2}$ or higher and 37mM salt concentration.
The results also show that local interactions dominate over dipole moment for this protein.
Improving immunoassay sensitivity may thus be assisted by numerical studies using our method (and open-source code), guiding changes to fabrication protocols or protein engineering of ligand molecules to obtain more favorable orientations.

\subsection{Reproducibility and data management}
We have a consistent reproducibility practice that includes releasing code and data associated with a publication. The \pygbe code was released at the time of submitting our previous publication,\cite{CooperBardhanBarba2013} under an MIT open-source license, and we maintain a version-control repository. As with our previous paper, we also release with this work all of the data needed to run the numerical experiments reported here, including running scripts and post-processing code in Python for producing the figures. To support our open-science goals, we prepared such a \emph{``reproducibility package''} for each of the results presented in Figures \ref{fig:1PGB_probability}, \ref{fig:1IGT_convergence}, and the probability plots in Figures \ref{fig:1IGT_negcharge} and \ref{fig:1IGT_poscharge}. The included running scripts invoke the \pygbe code with the correct input data and meshes (also included), and post-process the results to give the final figure, all with just one command. Please see the respective captions for a reference to the reproducibility packages, hosted on the \textbf{figshare} repository.
