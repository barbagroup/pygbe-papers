Dear Editor,

We submit for consideration in the journal our original research article titled 
“Probing protein orientation near charged nanosurfaces for simulation-assisted biosensor design,” 
intended for the topical category Surfaces; Interfaces; and Materials.

This study increases our understanding of how nanosurface properties (charge) and preparation conditions (salt levels) affect protein orientation. We also show that our modeling framework can match published results obtained with other methods, both experimental and direct molecular simulation with smaller molecules.

Favorable orientation of ligand molecules on bioactive surfaces is critical in biosensor sensitivity and performance. But studies so far have not resolved the question of how orientation can be influenced by surface preparation.

The article presents a physical adsorption study of immunoglobulin G using simulations of electrostatic interactions between the molecule and charged surfaces. The goal is to determine most-probable orientation of molecules on a nanosurface, as a function of the charge and solvent ionic content. Our results find  conditions for high-probability favorable orientation for the antibody iso-type IgG2a, which had not been found to have a preferred orientation in previous studies.

The research presented in our submission is new and original, and has not been 
submitted anywhere else. A preprint is deposited on the arXiv repository with ID 1503.08150v3).
