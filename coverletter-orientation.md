Dear Editor,

We submit for consideration in the journal our original research article titled 
“Probing protein orientation near charged nanosurfaces for simulation-assisted biosensor design,” 
intended for the topical category Surfaces; Interfaces; and Materials.

The article presents a physical adsorption study of immunoglobulin G using simulations of 
electrostatic interactions between the molecule and a charged surface. The goal is to 
determine most-probable orientation of molecules on a nanosurface, as a function of the 
charge and solvent ionic content. 

Favorable orientation of ligand molecules on bioactive surfaces is critical in biosensor 
sensitivity and performance. But studies so far have not resolved the question of how 
orientation can be influenced by surface preparation. 

This study increases our understanding of how nanosurface properties (charge) and 
preparation conditions (salt levels) affect protein orientation. We also show that 
our modeling framework can match published results obtained with other methods 
(experimental and direct molecular simulation).

The research presented in our submission is new and original, and has not been 
submitted anywhere else. A preprint is deposited on the arXiv repository with ID 1503.08150v3).
